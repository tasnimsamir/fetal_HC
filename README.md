The project is a trial to implement the technique described in "Direct estimation of fetal head circumference from ultrasound images based on regression CNN".

  The paper propose to leverage the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to directly measure the head circumference, without having to resort to handcrafted features or manually labeled segmented images.

Head circumference is a fetal biometric that is used to estimate gestational age and monitor growth of the fetus.

Dataset: the training dataset of HC18.
